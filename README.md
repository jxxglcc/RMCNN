This repository contains the code for RMCNN implemented with PyTorch.

More details in paper: A Riemannian Convolutional Nueral Network for EEG-Based Motor Imagery Decoding

## Implementations of FBCSP-SVM, FBCNet, FBMSNet,Conformer,  TSFCNet, Tensor-CSPNet, Graph-CSPNet and MAtt

ALL these benchmark methods are implemented in Pytorch.

FBCSP-SVM is provided at [https://github.com/fbcsptoolbox/fbcsp_code](https://github.com/fbcsptoolbox/fbcsp_code)
